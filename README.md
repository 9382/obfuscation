A bunch of personal mini projects related to or about obfuscation or stuff along those lines

Note that everything made here is made as a proof of concept/to theorycraft what it's like. Nothing here is amazing, and these were made for fun, and shouldn't ideally be used in anything serious as I can't guarantee the quality of anything here is any good.

A lot of the commit history is present [in my Dump repo](https://github.com/9382/Dump) which is where these projects originated
