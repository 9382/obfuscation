A bunch of personal mini projects related to or about obfuscation or stuff along those lines

Note that everything made here is made as a proof of concept/to theorycraft what it's like. Nothing here is designed with performance or elegance in mind, and these were made for fun, and shouldn't ideally be used in anything serious without proper testing.

A lot of the commit history is present [in my Dump repo](https://github.com/9382/Dump) which is where these projects originated
